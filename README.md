## About Porings and Ragnarok Online

Porings are iconic creatures from the MMORPG Ragnarok Online, which first launched in 2002. These adorable, gelatinous monsters are often the first enemies that new players encounter in the game. Despite their cute appearance, Porings are known for their voracious appetite, often swallowing items dropped by players!

In Ragnarok Online, Porings come in various types and colors, each with unique characteristics:

- Regular Poring: Pink and bouncy, the most common type.
- Drops: Blue Porings that drop healing items.
- Poporing: Green and poisonous.
- Marin: Aqua-colored Porings found near water.

This game pays homage to the beloved Poring species, bringing a piece of Ragnarok Online nostalgia to life through modern computer vision technology.
